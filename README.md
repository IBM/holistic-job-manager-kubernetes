Multi-Cluster App Dispatcher
==

The `multi-cluster-app-dispatcher` is a Kubernetes controller providing mechanisms for applications to manage batch jobs in a single or multi-cluster environment.

The `multi-cluster-app-dispatcher` (`MCAD`) controller is capable of (i) providing an abstraction for wrapping all resources of the job/application and treating them holistically, (ii) queuing job/application creation requests and applying different queuing policies, e.g., First In First Out, Priority, (iii) dispatching the job to one of multiple clusters, where a `MCAD` queuing agent runs, using configurable dispatch policies, and (iv) auto-scaling pod sets, balancing job demands and cluster availability (future work).
